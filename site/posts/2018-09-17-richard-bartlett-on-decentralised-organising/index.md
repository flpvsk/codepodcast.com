This is the interview we did with Richard, founder of
[Enspiral][enspiral], [Loomio][loomio] and [The Hum][thehum]. We got
introduced after [our episode on peer-to-peer tech][p2p-ep] was out. We
thought it would great to talk about decentralisation in the social
context, and that's what Rich has a lot of experience in.

We talk about benefits and challenges of working in an organisation where
responsibility, risk and reward are distributed across members. This is
not a technical discussion, this is a conversation about how can a group
of anarchists work together towards common goal.
