This is an unabridged interview with [Steve Klabnik](https://www.steveklabnik.com/)
that we originally did for the
[episode on concurrency](https://codepodcast.com/posts/2016-02-04-episode-1-concurrency-multithreading/).
Steve together with Carol Nichols just
released a new book ["The Rust Programming Language"](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-Steve-Klabnik/dp/1593278284),
so we decided to revisit the early stuff :)
