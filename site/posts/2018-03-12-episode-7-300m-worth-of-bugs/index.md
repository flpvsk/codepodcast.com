Imagine – your company's code and data are exposed. How long will it take
for malicious hackers to find vulnerabilities? To steal users' personal
information?

For developers that build on Ethereum that situation is not a distant
possibility, it's an everyday reality. All the code, the state and the
calls to their programs are publicly accessible and live forever on the
blockchain. Add to it the fact that their code will manipulate money.
Getting rid of *all* the bugs and holes becomes crucial.

In this episode we'll talk about software that finds bugs in other
software. Specifically ways of verifying Ethereum smart contracts.

The story begins in the summer of 2017 when someone is able to steal $30M
worth of ether.
