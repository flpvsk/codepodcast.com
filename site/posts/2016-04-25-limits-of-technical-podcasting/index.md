title: "Limits of technical podcasting"

Podcasts about programming are all the same. Sure, hosts and topics are
different, but the format is the same. And this format – it has it's
limitations.

For a long time I thought this was the way to do podcasting – you gather
with your friends and discuss recent news, things you like and things you
don't. Sometimes you interview people to get an outside perspective. All
of this is recorded and then, after little polishing, you release it.

I think it's an excellent way to introduce listeners to new techniques and
to developers in their community. This format has served well to shows
like [Ruby5][ruby5], [JSJabber][jsjabber], [Mostly Erlang][mostly-erlang]
and many others. I'm one of the hosts of a podcast like that. It's called
[RadioJS][radiojs], it's about JavaScript and it's in Russian.

On the other hand, there's a ton of subjects it's hard to talk about on
these podcasts: abstract concepts like design patterns, complicated
systems like the Internet and so on. Unless hosts know a lot about the
topic and have spoken publicly about it, it's hard to record a coherent
story in one take.

Interviews on these shows are often shallow. "What are you working on?"
"How did you get into programming?" "What does your library/framework do?"
Those dialogs are not very technical. I feel like they often miss an
opportunity to dive deep into person's work. Also, because it's usually
one guest per episode, there's no perspective. How are other people
solving similar problem? What do they have to say about alternative
solutions? These questions spin in my head as I listen to an episode.

## There's more to podcasting

We live in a golden age of podcasting. People make so many kinds of shows:
long form and short form, comedy and detective, narrative and
conversational.

Several months ago I've stumbled upon a show called [StartUp][startup].
It's a podcast about building a business. When I first heard it, I was
amazed.  The quality of the show, the story, everything was done very
professionally. I've never heard anything like this.

Later I've discovered [Ted Radio Hour][ted-radio-hour],
[Freekonomics][freekonomics] and [Planet Money][planet-money]. Their
format was different too. They would take one topic every episode and
explore it in depth from various perspectives. I knew it was time for a
different kind of a programming podcast, these shows gave me an idea about
what to try first.

## Significant bits

Together with my good friend [Michael Beschastnov][michael] we've launched
this experiment. We'd choose one coding concept every episode, take
several interviews, heavily edit them, add music and try to make a story
out of it. We would talk usage, implementations and alternative solutions.
We would give a comprehensive overview of a technical concept in 30
minutes or less.

We believe that ideas are more important than programming languages or
libraries or other tools. Once you understand the concept, it doesn't
matter if it's implemented in Python or in Node or in Haskell. You get how
it works. With this knowledge you can write new and debug existing code.
Often you don't even have to memorize the syntax of a target language to
do that.

This is our goal – share concepts in programming that we find
fascinating and make an entertaining story out of it.

## Explore

We love how this experiment is going so far. There're things we like about
**Code** and things we don't, but the process of making it is super fun.
Seeing listeners feedback is very rewarding.

At this moment we have released 3 episodes. They make up one series
entitled "Concurrency". The show is taking shape, but we still have a
backlog of ideas to try.

We have dived into one format, but there are so many others. Programming
podcasts are all the same nowadays, but it doesn't have to be like that. I
would encourage you to experiment. Think of an idea for a show and then
just record it! Record one episode and share it with your friends and
colleagues or put it out on iTunes or SoundCloud. Send it to us, we are
always searching for new ways to do technical podcasting. If you don't
have time to record it – send the idea anyway!

There's a lot to explore in the world of programming podcasts, let's kick
off the scouting!
